How the Bootloading procedure works:

1. bootloader.asm: Initializes BIOS, it contains code to make the BIOS detect that we have a bootable media
2. bootloader.asm calls DiskRead.asm, which reads more sectors of the disk, which contains the "ExtendedProgram"

ExtendedProgram will handle further operations
3. Enable A20
4. Enter 32-bit protected mode
5. Detect CPUID support     -> halt if fails
6. Detect Long Mode support -> halt if fails
7. Enable paging; physical memory will be identically mapped to virtual memory

Memory mapping table will reside in memory between the bootloader and the kernel
